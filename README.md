REST service to make financial accounting easy for the individual. Get the overview of your private economy, like the big businesses do. (This is made by a person with no financial education, so these claims will maybe not be met)

To be able to make proper analyses as easy as possible, I will try to learn from the concepts of double entry bookkeeping. Most of my knowledge in this regard will come from James who made this YouTube playlist: [ACCOUNTING BASICS for Beginners (Whole Playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5zKSeS09l339nB6ujJPQ9Rsv99_b-aTb).

## Roadmap
1. Convert bank transaction posting to a JournalEntry and LineItems as shown in Figure 1 (manually through some front end).
2. Show economic balance sheet of a general ledger
3. Create rules for automatic conversion of bank transactions to double entry bookkeeping (should be available through front end).
